App‑Compose is fundamentally task‑centric: composition is organized around Tasks and their Contexts. Tasks are connected only through Context. There are three ways to do that:

1. Using a Tag
1. By depending directly on another Task's result
1. Using a `literal`

## When to use each approach

### Tag

Use a Tag when you need a Task to be maximally reusable across different contexts and conditions.

<Sandbox template="vanilla" code={tag} options={{ layout: "console", showConsoleButton: false }} />

### Direct dependencies

Use direct dependencies when the relationship between tasks is stable and unlikely to change.<br/>
Make this an intentional choice. When in doubt, prefer Tags.

<Sandbox template="vanilla" code={direct} options={{ layout: "console", showConsoleButton: false }} />

### Literal

Use a literal to seed context for possible future flexibility, like switching to a Tag.<br/>
But treat it as a conscious choice. In many cases, it is premature optimization.

<Sandbox template="vanilla" code={literal} options={{ layout: "console", showConsoleButton: false }} />
