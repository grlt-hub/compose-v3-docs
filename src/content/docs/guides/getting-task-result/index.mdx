Most of the time, you get Task results from Context. Sometimes you need the result after the app has finished running. For example, you might render a JSX that a Task returns once all stages complete. In that case, use the _Scope_ returned by `compose().run()` and call `get()`. If a Task was skipped or failed, `get()` returns _undefined_.
