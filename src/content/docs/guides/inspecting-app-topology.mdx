import Sandbox from "../../../components/sandbox/index.astro"
import graph from "../home/graph.js?raw"

As your app grows, understanding how different tasks interact can become difficult. Instead of digging through folders to trace dependencies, you can use the `.graph()` fn to get a clear map of your system.

<Sandbox template="vanilla" code={graph} options={{ layout: "console", showConsoleButton: false }} />

The `.graph()` returns a structured object representing your app topology. You can visualize this data using tools like Mermaid or render it as a simple text map to see the relationships between Tasks and Tags at a glance:

```
[alpha] ──> <title> ──> [beta]
      └ ─ ─ > [gamma] (optional)
```
