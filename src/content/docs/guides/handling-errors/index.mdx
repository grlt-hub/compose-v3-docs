In real apps, things go wrong. A network request might fail, a data transformation might error out, or an external service might be unavailable. When this happens, App-Compose isolates the failure so the rest of your app continues to work as expected.

Task errors only come from `run.fn` or `enabled.fn`.

## Failure behavior

If a Task fails, App-Compose marks it as _failed_ and keeps the app running. Any Task that strictly depends on it, directly or through Tags, is marked as _skipped_.

<Sandbox template="vanilla" code={failureBehaviour} options={{ layout: "console" }} />

## Logging Failures

By default, App-Compose logs a warning to the console when a Task fails. You can customize this behavior with the `onTaskFail`. This is useful for separating dev and production handling, for example sending errors to a logging system like Sentry.

<Sandbox
  template="vanilla"
  code={onTaskFail}
  options={{ layout: "console", showConsoleButton: false, editorWidthPercentage: 70 }}
/>
